This repository demonstrates CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions
(A) the first workflow is named "build-and-push-v2.yml".  It builds a simple word rest service running in a container and pushes the image to DockerHub.   It pushes the image with the tag "latest" 
and with the tag <DATE>, where <DATE> is the current date.
(B) the second workflow is named "pull-and-test-image-v2.yml" pulls the latest image from DockerHub and runs tests against it.   The tests are a few simple curl commands.   We record 
the commands and the results of the commands so they are visible in the workflow log.
(C) the third workflow is "build-test-push-v4.yml".  it is a more realistic scenario.  it has two jobs.  the first job builds the image and then, if successful, uploads it to GitHub.  the second
job downloads the image from GitHub and runs it in a container.   It then runs a suite of tests on it, using a standard testing tool.   It uploads the test results to GitHub.   If all the 
tests are successful, it pushes the image to DockerHub.   Once the workflow completes, the test results are available to download from GitHub.   

NOTE that in order to load the image to DockerHub, you need to define (in your own repo where you copy this repo to) the following GITHUB secrets: DOCKER_COURSE_USERNAME and 
DOCKER_COURSE_PASSWORD.  If there are any hardcoded usernames in the code for the DockerHub username (e.g., in pull-and-test-image-v2.yml), replace them with your own
DockerHub username.
