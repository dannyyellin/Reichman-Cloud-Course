This repository has two versions of the rest-word-svr program, and two versions of a Dockerfile.

rest-word-svr-v1.py is the same version of the program we used for Topic-1: REST APIs.   We just take that program and instead of 
running it as a standalone program, we run it in a Docker container.   We create the image (and then the container) using the Dockerfile
in this directory.

rest-work-svr-v2.py is a slightly modified version of this program.   It removes the command to use Flask from the main program.   Instead,
it can be run from the command line To run this program from a terminal window issue the cmds:
     export FLASK_APP="rest-word-svr-v2.py"
     flask run --port 8000    
The first command sets an environment variable which tells Flask which program to run (the exact syntax for setting environment variables may differ 
depending on what shell you are using).   The second command invokes python and then Flask and tells it to run the program having it listen on port
8000.  This is a better way to run the program because it removes IP and port addresses from the program code, and allows one to change where the program 
is run without modifying code.   I.e., insteasd of port 8000 you can run it to listen on a different port by just changing an environment
variable or by using different flags in the command line.   

We also give an example Dockerfile for running rest-word-svr-v2.py.   We call it Dockerfile.setport.  The difference between this and the previous 
Dockerfile is that Dockerfile.setport sets the Flask environment variables (to point at the correct application and to run on port 8000), and also sets the
command "flask run --port 8000" to be run when the container starts up.   
Note that the environment variables set in Dockerfile.setport can be overridden on the command line.
